Final project for ECE5930: Radar Signal Processing

The project uses Matlab to set up and simulate a SAR system, and forms images using back-projection. The user can choose between two simulated data scenes: 1) a point target, and 2) an image that says USU when the image has been formed.

Instructions: 

Run `SAR_BPJ_sim.m`

The project defaults to Image 2. To switch to Image 1, change line 8 in `SAR_BPJ_sim.m` to `image = 1;`
